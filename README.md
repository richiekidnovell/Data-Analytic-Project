# Data-Analytic-Project

Project Overview
In this project, I am working as a data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm. My focus is on providing data-driven solutions and insights. The current task involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC).

The goal is to gain a general understanding of taxi ridership patterns in New York City. Specifically, I aim to structure and clean the data, and then create meaningful visualizations using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) and Tableau. These visualizations should be easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders, and accessible to individuals with visual impairments.

Tasks
The tasks involved in this project are as follows:

Data Structuring and Cleaning: I will perform data cleaning operations on the NYC TLC dataset to ensure the data is consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis.

Data Visualization (Python): Using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, I will generate a series of plots to better understand the data. These will include (but are not limited to) a box plot of ride durations and time series plots showing ride patterns broken down by quarter or month.

Data Visualization (Tableau): I will create a Tableau dashboard showing a map of New York City with taxi/limo trips categorized by month. The dashboard will be designed with accessibility in mind, particularly for individuals with visual impairments.

Instructions
This project includes a Python notebook that serves as a guide through the EDA and data visualization process. You are expected to complete the sections of the notebook where indicated. The notebook includes both code and markdown cells, which will guide you through the analysis and allow you to document your findings.

Final Note
Remember, the ultimate goal is to provide insights that are accessible and meaningful to a broad audience. My visualizations should tell a clear story about NYC taxi ridership and be easy to interpret for someone who isnâ€™t data savvy
